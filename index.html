      The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficiant then they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared and detailed descriptionof their ingrediants help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices.Each student or staff member who acceses the canteen could be provided with a school canteen account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have.Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less conplicated for staff and student alike.Here again,diversity is the key.

        Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students' absenteeism. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual conceptts of their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment Numnber or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span - just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educations institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reducced costs.
